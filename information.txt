Flask App Features
This Flask application manages user registration, login, and allows you to mark phone numbers as spam. It stores user data in a MySQL database and monitors spam reports using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. The application has these main features:

1. User Registration
Endpoint: /users/register (post request)
Description: A new user can register by entering their name, email, phone number, and password.
Security: Passwords are hashed (encrypted) before being stored in the database.
Response:
Success: The user successfully registered.
Error: If the phone number already exists, it will return an error.

2. User Login URL: /users/login (POST request)
Description: Allows a registered user to log in using their phone number and password.
Security: If the credentials are valid, an access token (JWT) is generated for authentication.
Response: Success: Returns an access token to the user.
Error: If the credentials are invalid, it returns an error.

3. Search User Endpoint: /users/search (get request)
Description: A logged-in user can search for another user using their phone number.
Security: The user must log in (JWT token required).
Response: Success! Retrieves user information (name, phone number, and spam count).
Error: If the user cannot be discovered or there is a problem with the request, an error message is returned.

4. Mark the phone number as Spam.
Endpoint: /users/addspam (post request)
Description: A logged-in user can mark a phone number as spam.
Security: The user must log in (JWT token required).
Response:
Success: Marks the phone number as spam and keeps a record.
Error: If there is an issue with the database or request, an error message is returned.
